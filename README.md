# Book Store Website

An implementation of an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture on a bookstore website.

The code is written in .NET Core, MSSQL Server (Entity Framework Core), Javascript, Html, CSS.
The application allows users to browse through a collection of books, and create new books. Users can also register and log in to the application.
I did both the back and frontend myself.
